This is an accompanying mobile app to the web app written in React.

### How it works

One can sync the taks of the current week and then they show in the app. Inside the app there is a record time feature. The recorded times per task can be synced back to the main app.

### How the items get synced

Currently I'm running the app only locally. So the data needed for this will need to be synced to Azure and I'll use a simple API inside Azure for handling the data exchange.
