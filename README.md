# TimeTrackerPlanner
This is a web tool for keeping track of time and doing weekly planning.

I have a number of projects I work on and I want to keep track of how much time I spend on each.

So far I've been doing this in Excel.
I just had 4 rows and entered the information like this:

Date:\
Start Time|Project|Duration in Minutes|Detail

For example:

24.06.2018\
16:00|microsoft certification|30|exam 70-486\
16:30|learnclick|15|bug fix

At the end of a week I also write down in my diary, what I plan to do the following week.

I plan to combine these 2 things and also add estimates to my planing. The time tracker will allow me to check how
much time I actually spent on a task.

The finished product will be running in the browser. The main goal of this project is to get more experience using ASP.NET.

Later on I also plan to create a mobile app that will just be used for adding tasks when I'm not on my computer and don't have an
internet connection. This will be done using React and the data will be synced via Azure.
